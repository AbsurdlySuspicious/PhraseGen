# PhraseGen

Pattern-based random phrase generation utility using WordNet dictionaries

It can be used in set of purposes such as name or password generation, inspiration for your new username or anything else you can think of

When using for password generation, make sure you will __not__ use generated phrases as-is. Consider adding some numbers and case-variety to make it more strong before brute-force attacks
